About the C code generating system in this directory
----------------------------------------------------

This set of Mathematica scripts in MathematicaToC can be quite useful at
generating C code. However, we want to stress that the way we access the C
arrays of sgrid via Mathematica is fragile. Any mistake in the declared
symmetries or in the order of variables in a Mathematica script will lead to
C code that accesses the wrong arrays or even arrays that do not exist.
Also, any small omission or syntax error results in C code that will not
even compile. When this happens it is hard to track down such an error. Thus
the system has to be used with caution.
