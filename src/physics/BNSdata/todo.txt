*check if regridding works propoerly
*check if q is calculated correctly
*maybe do q_{new} = w q_{computed from fields} + (1-w) q_{old}
 choose w<1, so that q does not change too much (currently we have w=1)
 [this only works if iterations overshoot]
*maybe adjust Omega as Pedro did, and also maybe xCM

*in all .m files check if we need to call Ind("name"), maybe it's already
 defined as index_name by a math module
