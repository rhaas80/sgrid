*check if regridding works propoerly
*check if q is calculated correctly
*maybe do q_{new} = w q_{computed from fields} + (1-w) q_{old}
 choose w<1, so that q does not change too much (currently we have w=1)
 [this only works if iterations overshoot]
*maybe adjust Omega as Pedro did, and also maybe xCM

*in all .m files check if we need to call Ind("name"), maybe it's already
 defined as index_name by a math module

*newton_linesrch_its(Cvec, 1, &check, m01_error_VectorFunc, 1000, tol*0.01);
 also changes things on star2 in box4. Probably it just changes the size of
 box4 and interpolates onto it correctly, but that is unnecesary and may be
 even harmful for the overall iteration.

*use spinning NS from RNS code instead TOV as initial guess
