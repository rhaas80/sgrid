===========================
Compute corotating configs:
===========================
for the 1st paper [Class.Quant.Grav.26:175018,2009] with 
corotating configurations I mostly used:
BNSdata_adjust = keep_xmax always print_current_xmax

This means:
===========
0. set up initial guess:
-choose rest masses m01 and m02
-choose fields as TOV, maybe with initial shift as in gr-qc/0007028v2
-find constants C1 and C2 in integrated Euler eqn for each star
-integrated Euler eqn for corot is:  h = -C u^0
-in my fist paper I use q instead of h
-the specific enthalpy h is proportional to q:  h = (n+1)q + 1
-n is in exponent of EOS: P = kappa rho0^(1+1/n), usually I use n=1
-use PN guess for Omega and xCM
-find and save x_max1 and x_max2, i.e. max of q along x-axis (line connecting
 the 2 stars)

Iterate:
--------
1. solve elliptic eqns for each variable one after another, in this order:
BNSdata_Psi BNSdata_Bx BNSdata_By BNSdata_Bz BNSdata_alphaP

2. update u =(BNSdata_Psi BNSdata_Bx BNSdata_By BNSdata_Bz BNSdata_alphaP)
by using:
 u_new = (1-w) u_old + w u_ell
where w=0.2 and u_ell is what we have from elliptic solve in 1.

3. choose Omega and xCM such that dq/dx|x_max1/2 = 0
where:
-here x_max1/2 are max of q along x-axis (line connecting the 2 stars) from
 the previous iteration
-q and dq/dx|x_max are computed from the integrated Euler eqn using u_new
-we do not change C1/2 in this step at all.
-my function that does all this is called adjust_Omega_xCM_keep_dqdxmax_eq_0

4. adjust constants C1 and C2 in integrated Euler eqn
-define rest mass m01/2 as in Eq. 41. This is a function of C1/2.
-choose C1/2 such that m01/2 is the same as before. 
-my function that does all this is called adjust_C1_C2_q_keep_restmasses

5. if residuals are not low enough go back to 1.

All this is described in Class.Quant.Grav.26:175018,2009 in Sec 3.3.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

For my 3rd paper (Phys. Rev. D 86, 064024 (2012)) with spins I changed this
algorithm slightly. The only necessary change was in step 3. 
I now use Eq. (29) of Phys. Rev. D 86, 064024 (2012) instead of 
dq/dx|x_max1/2 = 0. This is described in Sec. III of Phys. Rev. D 86, 064024
(2012).
