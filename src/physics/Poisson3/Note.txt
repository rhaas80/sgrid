About the Poisson3 project:
---------------------------
We solve 2 coupled Poisson eqs for Psi and Chi:
 Chi Psixx + Psiyy + Chi Chi Psizz[i] = rh1
 Chixx + Psix Chiyy + Chizz = rh2


Some explanations:
------------------

sgrid_Poisson3.c
----------------
-most important file
-defines vars like Poisson3_Psi that we solve for
-schedules functions like Poisson3_startup or Poisson3_solve that we want
 to call

Poisson3.c
----------
-contains most functions that are called
-E.g. the 2 coupled Poisson eqs are inside the functionÂ F_Poisson3
-F_Poisson3 is passed to the Newton solver by Poisson3_solve which was
 scheduled in sgrid_Poisson3.c
-The Newton solver also needs the linearized equations which are in the
 function J_Poisson3.

Poisson3_BCs.c
--------------
-contains boundary conditions (BCs)
-func Poisson3_set_BCs sets BCs using Poisson3_set_interbox_and_outerBCs
