About the source and the window func:
-------------------------------------
In the phi- and theta-directions, Ian's source behaves 
qualitatively like this:
s[ph_] = D[ psi[ph], ph,ph]
where
psi[ph_] = 5e-5 * (Cos[ph]+2.5)Sin[ph/2]^3 + Cos[ph]
(* PlotData["psi.phi", psi[x], {x,0,2Pi}, 400]
   PlotData["s.phi", s[x], {x,0,2Pi}, 400]          *)

Such a psi can be described up to 1-e3 at phi=0 with a 12 Fourier coeffs.
(which I concluded using ~/c/FT_1Ddata.c)
If the source orbits at r=10 this corresponds to a resolution of only
h=2*pi*10/12 = 5.24.

However, in the radial direction Ian's source has spikes from the 
window function that are 10^5 times the size of the source.
To resolve both Ian suggested a res of about h=1/25, which
is 125 better than what we seem to need without window func.

Filtering:
----------
from
ygraph oldSource_6boxes_O1_32_24_fall/ScalarOnKerr_Pi_rms.2 \
 oldSource_6boxes_O1_Ylm_lmshift32_24_fall/ScalarOnKerr_Pi_rms.2
we see that we need the Ylm_lmshift filter, and that we need to filter
psi, Pi, phi_i to obtain stability till 1000M.

Note: lmax = n2/4 - 1 for phi_i 
      lmax = n2/4 - 2 for Pi and psi

So far n3 = 0.75 n2 is working, but n3 = 0.5 n2 might work also???
(but then we would not filter at all in the Z-direction)?


About convergence:
------------------
oS_1box_lmsh.par is convergent
ConvRatio_withDiffs oS_1box_lmsh_22_20_16/ScalarOnKerr_psi_rms.0 \
 oS_1box_lmsh_26_20_16/ScalarOnKerr_psi_rms.0 \
 oS_1box_lmsh_30_20_16/ScalarOnKerr_psi_rms.0 | ygraph -
gives a ConvRatio ~ 4.5

oS_2boxes_lmsh.par are both oS_2boxes_lrgdt_lmsh.par convergent,
even though the latter has a 7 times bigger time step dt
ConvRatio_withDiffs oS_2boxes_lrgdt_lmsh_22_20_16/ScalarOnKerr_psi_rms.0 \
 oS_2boxes_lrgdt_lmsh_26_20_16/ScalarOnKerr_psi_rms.0 \
 oS_2boxes_lrgdt_lmsh_30_20_16/ScalarOnKerr_psi_rms.0 | ygraph -
gives a ConvRatio ~ 7 (actually both have 7)

oS_3boxes_lmsh.par is convergent
ConvRatio_withDiffs oS_3boxes_lmsh_22_20_16/ScalarOnKerr_psi_rms.0 \
 oS_3boxes_lmsh_26_20_16/ScalarOnKerr_psi_rms.0 \
 oS_3boxes_lmsh_30_20_16/ScalarOnKerr_psi_rms.0 | ygraph -
gives a ConvRatio ~ 6.8

I have trouble with getting my 6 boxes thing to converge!
E.g. oS_lmsh.par or nW_lmsh.par

Also, Ian's source does not converge so well:
ygraph nW_lmsh_18_20_16/ScalarOnKerr_rho_rms.2 \
 nW_lmsh_22_24_18/ScalarOnKerr_rho_rms.2 \
 nW_lmsh_26_28_22/ScalarOnKerr_rho_rms.2
Reason: If a source with more angular (e.g. Fourier) coeffs as 
exactly resolved orbits, all its coeffs retained by the code oscillate.
The more angular points the faster this oscillation. Thus it's
convergence is masked.
