about s2kit version 1.0:
------------------------
wtest.c and YlmFilter.c are made from test_naive.c
bw in wtest.c is B in s2kit_fx.pdf.

samples need to be taken at the points:
theta_j = PI*(2j + 1)/(4bw), where j = 0,1, ... ,2bw-1
these are the points of SphericalDF if n2%4=0
I.e. we need to use bw=box->n2/4, then l_max=bw-1 and m_max=lmax in the Plm

Also note that Y_l^{-m}(th,0) = (-1)^m Y_l^{m}(th,0), the same goes thus
for the Plm in s2kit.
