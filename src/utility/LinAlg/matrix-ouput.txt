The function
write_SparseVectorArray_inMatrixMarketFormat
in SparseVector_utils.c can output sparse matrices in MatrixMarket Format.

It is used in e.g. src/utility/GridIterators/wrappers_for_UMFPACK.c if we set
GridIterators_verbose = yes very

This produces files of the form lop_matrix2_13s.mtx . Such matrices can be
loaded into octave with the included mmread.m :
octave
A1 = mmread("t3/lop_matrix2_13s.mtx")
cond(A1)

The last line prints the condition number of the matrix.
