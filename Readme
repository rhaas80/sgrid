Readme file for 'sgrid'
-----------------------
Wolfgang Tichy, 9/2023


'sgrid' is a code for numerical relativity using spectral methods.
The code is private for now (don't distribute yet, please). But it will soon
be made public under the GPL. See the files LICENSE and COPYING.

Documentation:
--------------
The main documentation and compilation instructions are in doc/sgrid.txt ,
but see also doc/MyConfig.example .
Furthermore, many dirs have Note.txt files with additional hints.


6/2022 Plans for making SGRID public:
-------------------------------------
*move some modules that are currently in physics into a new dir e.g.
 old_physics
*make some modules that are currently in physics into their own projects

==> There is now utility/numerics which should be used instead NumericUtils.

*still todo:
------------
*Change DNSdataTwoFluid so that it works without NumericUtils.
 Until then DNSdataTwoFluid still needs:
libpaths += src/utility/NumericUtils
