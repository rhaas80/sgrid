Readme file for 'sgrid'
-----------------------
Wolfgang Tichy, 4/2005


'sgrid' is a code for numerical relativity using spectral methods. 
The code is private for now (don't distribute, please). 


sgrid is supposed to be:
- extremely simple


6/2022 Plans for making SGRID public:
-------------------------------------
*move some modules that are currently in physics into a new dir e.g.
 old_physics
*make some modules that are currently in physics into their own projects

*do not compile the old utility/NumericUtils by default anymore (so that we
 can remove it later)
*add utility/numerics from Nmesh instead
*add new func shims to utility/numerics that have the same names as the ones
 needed from utility/NumericUtils, which simply call the funcs from nmesh or
 from the GSL
*e.g. make a new odeintegrate that simply calls gsl_odeiv2_driver_apply and
 optionally also stores the kmax data points like it is done in
 integrate_TOV_ODE.c from nmesh to show the TOV table on the screen
