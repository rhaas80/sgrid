Visualization of 0D, 1D and 2D output
-------------------------------------
Usually sgrid outputs ASCII text files for 0D, 1D and 2D output (with file
name endings like .X0 or .XY0). They can be plotted with e.g. gnuplot or
ygraph. However, it is more comfortable to use tgraph form

for this.

Visualization of 3D output
-------------------------- 
sgrid can also output 3D data either in VTK legacy format or in sgrid's
own binary format. To visualize it, we can use programs like ParaView or
xyzgraph which comes with bam. We can also get 1D or 2D slices of the 3D
data by using the utilities
sgrid/utilities/sgrid3d_to_1d.c    sgrid/utilities/sgrid3d_to_2d.c
These slices can then be plotted with tgraph.
