General tips about using git:
-----------------------------

# to start a new repo, got inside the dir and do
git init

# use bare repos on the central server, you start them with
git init --bare

# get repo sgrid.git from titan (works for any other repo you can access)
git clone ssh://titan/home/wolf/Archives/sgrid.git

# check status of what commit will do
git status

# make changes to some files and then put them into the local repo
git add -u
git status
git commit .

# Add .gitignore in a dir to let git ignore some files in there.
# .gitignore simply contains the file names (one per line).
# if .gitignore contains * use:
git add -f .gitignore 

# push changes to central server (--dry-run with dry run it doesn't do it)
git status
git push --dry-run
git push

# if I accidentally delete filename.txt I can get it back with one of those:
git checkout -- .
git checkout -- filename.txt

# check if something has changed on server
git remote show origin

# pull from central server. This does a fetch and then a merge.
git pull

# fetch from server
# unlike pull this only fetches, we need to use "git merge" later
git fetch
git status
#   ^ might say something like this:
# "Your branch is behind 'origin/master' by 2 commits, and can be
#  fast-forwarded."
# to get a log and diff about these commits type:
git log master...origin/master
git diff master origin/master
# to merge changes into my working copy do:
git merge origin/master
