Things to do for sgrid
--------------------

Feel free to add to this file. This is our internal feature request
and project list. Note that there are three categories.
Please enter bugs in Bugs.txt instead.



BIG
---

clean up variable/function/directory names

documentation

Checkpointing




Medium
------

Bin for gauge in ICN et al so that each evolution library doesn't have
to do it by itself

Output for 2d and 3d with subsampling

Write an interpolator that e.g. would allow to integrate over a sphere.

Add basic calculator to parameter parser, e.g.
parameter = parameter/2



small
-----

main/util.c, error exit functions should print info where the problem occured
e.g. #define errorexit(s) errorexit(s,__FILE__)




------------------------------------------------------------------------------
On hold
-------

extract ADM mass, momentum, spin
wave extraction
-> handled by Cactus/HDF5 interface right now

FishEye (by-passed by FMR for now)

Output for all refinement levels simultaneously
(currently handled for 1d by Nina's scripts)

Kerr-Schild binary black hole data
(this project is on hold, now working on spectral thin-sandwich solver)

Radiative boundary: add monopole
(wait until we see problem with wave extraction)

Optimization:
- worth the effort to go to local variable groups?
  In principle, yes, but not worth the effort.
  Should look at optimization ones code reaches more stable state.
- Introduce synchronization for tensors and variable lists. The
  interface is already there, but there is just a loop over single
  variable synchs. Benchmark performance.
