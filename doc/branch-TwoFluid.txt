Hannes Rueter made changes all over sgrid for the two Projects:
 DNSdataTwoFluid
 MultiEoS
Hannes' changes are in branch TwoFluid.

In November 2022 WT looked at them. Here is what we think:

Improvements we like in TwoFluid
---------------------------------
src/Math/MathToC/TensorEquationsToC.m  : DONE.
src/Math/MathToC/expandindices.m       : DONE.
src/Math/MathToC/optimize.m            : DONE.
src/Math/MathToC/writeC.m              : DONE.

src/main/MemoryMan/list_templates.h          : DONE.
src/utility/Coordinates/sgrid_Coordinates.c  : DONE.
src/utility/GridIterators/Newton.c           : DONE.

src/utility/output/VTK_out.c   : DONE.
src/utility/output/output.h    : DONE.
src/utility/output/output3d.c  : DONE.

src/utility/NumericUtils/newton_lnsrch.c  : DONE.

The "DONE." above indicates that WT has merged the relevant parts into the
branch new_master (which will itself be merged into master). 

The Mathics stuff in src/Math/MathToC/ could not just be used as is, because
it broke Mathematica compatibility, which we plan to keep for now. We have
tested that what is in new_master now, works under Mathematica and still
gives identical results. Yet, it should now also work with Mathics 5, but
this remains to be tested, and it sure is not exactly as in branch TwoFluid.

The VTK related stuff src/utility/output was taken more or less verbatim
from TwoFluid, but VTK output with point coords only happens if we say
3dformat = vtk addpoints

NOTE:
We won't merge stuff from main, even though some of the const stuff might be
good. It's just to hard to test if all other projects will keep working wit
this....


Improvements in TwoFluid that we need to worry about:

commit 3d6ab7b4eae9cbaca285790568775d5670dbea26

    Attempt to make box_extremum_of_F_in_dir more stable
---
@@ -213,22 +213,6 @@
In func box_extremum_of_F_in_dir there are these extra lines in TwoFluid:
+  if(stat<0) {
+    // fields can oscillate at the outer bounds
+    // try again with tighter bounds
+    printf("trying again with tighter bounds\n");
+
+    Cl = box->bbox[(dir-1)*2];
+    Ch = box->bbox[(dir-1)*2+1];
+    const double center = (Cl + Ch)/2;
+    const double dC = (Ch - Cl);
+
+    Cl = center - dC / 4;
+    Ch = center + dC / 4;
+
+    stat = zbrac_P(f1_from_c1_dir_ZP, &Cl,&Ch, (void *) par);
+  }
+
BUT I do not like this!!! It searches in a greatly reduced interval. This
can only cause trouble! I wonder if DNSdataTwoFluid actually needs this???
If so, it should make its own private box_extremum_of_F_in_dir function!!!

commit 8713789aa14fb8304b4e6787a1a7d9b422d25df3

    Add maximum norm to the yscale in odeintegrate
---
The main diff is this:
- yscal[i]=fabs(y[i])+fabs(dydx[i]*h)+TINY;
+ yscal[i]=max_abs_scale*max_absy[i]+fabs(y[i])+fabs(dydx[i]*h)+TINY;
I.e. we scale differently.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              




----------------------------------------------------------------------------

So we consider the partial merge of TwoFluid done now. Nobody should ever
attempt to just merge TwoFluid into master now. It's not what we want and
would also results in tons of conflicts.
