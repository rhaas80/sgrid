Some defines in sgrid:
----------------------
NOTE: In C99 these two have the same effect:
   #pragma omp parallel for
   _Pragma ( "omp parallel for" )

In sgrid there are defines like this:
#define SGRID_LEVEL6_Pragma(x)  _Pragma ( #x )

To parallelize with OpenMP we need _Pragma ( "omp parallel for" ) in many
places.  But for different applications we want to switch them on or off
depending on where they are.
SGRID_LEVEL2_Pragma used for omp loops over a plane in a box (2d)
SGRID_LEVEL3_Pragma used for omp loops over all points in a box (3d)
SGRID_LEVEL4_Pragma used for omp loops over all boxes
SGRID_LEVEL6_Pragma used for 6d omp loops (e.g. loop over box while interpolating onto each point) 


Switch on OpenMP directives in MyConfig:
----------------------------------------
#for icc compile with
OFLAGS = -O3 -openmp 

#for gcc compile with 
OFLAGS = -O3 -fopenmp

# use OpenMP pragmas of LEVEL6
DFLAGS += -DLEVEL6_Pragmas


To start sgrid with 2 OpenMP treads:
------------------------------------
export OMP_NUM_THREADS=2
./sgrid test.par
