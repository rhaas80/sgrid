6/2022 Plans for making SGRID public:
-------------------------------------

*move some stuff out of dir src/physics
 (google How to Move a Directory to New Git Repository with Commit History)
  ==>
# First of all, clone the main repository that contains a directory to move.
git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/PRIMARY-REPO.git 

# Change directory to the newly cloned repository
cd REPOSITORY-NAME

# Next, the filter-branch option lets you rewrite Git revision history by
# rewriting the branches mentioned in the command line. This will filter the
# subdirectory from the rest of the files in the current repository.
git filter-branch --prune-empty --subdirectory-filter SUB_DIRECTORY_NAME BRANCH_NAME 
# Here:
# SUB_DIRECTORY_NAME: The relative path to the directory within the project
# files, you need to separate from others.
# BRANCH_NAME: Select the branch name from which the directory will be filtered,
# like “main”, “master”, “develop” etc. Once the above command executed
# successfully, you will see that the current directory has only files that
# were in the subdirectory.

# Create a new repository.
# Set the new URL as the origin of the current directory. This is the same
# directory where you have filtered code from the previous git repository.
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/USERNAME/NEW_REPO_NAME.git 

# Next, verify that the Git origin URLs have been updated.
git remote -v 

# Finally, Push all the files to the new repository.
git push -u origin BRANCH_NAME 

# Btw, IF this works enter it into tricks/git

*dir in src/physics that should be public:
 ADMvars ConvTest ModeComputer Poisson3 ScalarOnKerr ScalarWave SingleBH
 TestDerivs TestID testwave
 BTW, BSSN could be public if I ask Bernd first...

*dirs to move out of src/physics:
 BSSN BNSdata PN_CircularOrbit_GWs Poisson Poisson2 Z4secondO
 rename BNSdata to BNSdata_v1 (this should not be needed anymore)

*all the things we move out we put into private repos on quark into the
 subdir sgrid-projects

*copy doc/nmesh.txt to doc/sgrid.txt

*Run some cases with spin where we use
 DNSdata_new_q = FromFields
 to test the sign issue Roxana told me about.


About github
------------
*use "GitHub Free for organizations"
*in my personal account under "Settings" I can then create new orgnizations
 for free
*make one organization for the main sgrid, for all its projects, and all
 python scripts
*can later make another organization for nmesh
*an organization has a 500MB limit (does this count against my personal
 account limit of also 500MB?)
*use "Copy an entire repo to a new server" in wolfGIT/tricks/git to get
 sgrid repo into github

==> I made the organization https://github.com/sgridsource
*in it we have: sgrid, DNSdata, EoS_T0 and EccRed
*need READMEs for all of them


6/2022 Plans for making SGRID public:
-------------------------------------
*There is now utility/numerics which should be used instead NumericUtils.

*still todo:
------------
*There is now utility/numerics which should be used instead NumericUtils.
*Change DNSdataTwoFluid so that it works without NumericUtils.
 Until then DNSdataTwoFluid still needs:
libpaths += src/utility/NumericUtils
