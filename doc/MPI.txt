Sgrid does not use MPI yet, it only uses OpenMP!

Comments on using MPI in BAM which may be helpful
-------------------------------------------------

Even though some wrappers are already in the code to allow compilation
without MPI, this is incomplete.

The bottom line is: 
- you have to use MPI even if you are working on single processor machine
  (note that you can test multiprocessor code on single processors)
- you have to edit the main Makefile to put in the paths to find your version
  of MPI
