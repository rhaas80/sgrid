Things to do for sgrid: ISCO evolutions
--------------------


fmr:
-----------
apples with apples tests with refinement
convergence tests
trivial parallelization for symmetric grids (factor 2 for m1 approx m2)
spheres (factor 2): seem to work but not as clean convergence



ISCO data:
-----------
thin sandwich data with excision from spectral code


boundary:
---------
better masses, invariants, waves: improved attenuation 
(already partially successfull)


coordinates:
------------
shift to counter flattening
shift to keep AH size (seems to be working)


numerics:
---------
dissipation?
enforcer?


analysis:
---------
Cactus EHF



Priorities:
===========

1. clean merger run for small x
- EH and AH for merger run

2. convergence tests: 
- summarize current results
- fmr: single puncture, single KS, waves
- unigrid convergence

3. analysis: get better ADM mass, invariants, wave forms
- rigid rotation? attenuation?

4. better gauge for large x

5. perhaps can do special fmr physics?
- far head-on
- large mass ratio

6. parallel fmr (do symmetric grid parallel first, use parameter parallelism)




DONE
----
26.12.03 Submitted orbit paper.
multigrid for puncture data
quadrant/rotant/pitant (factor 2)
excision: try hi-res punctures first (onedt/bo transition?)
outer boundary: spherical/cylindrical
                radiative with shift? causal diff?
corotation shift
parameter file repository
Cactus/HDF5: AHF, waves
fmr: bo instead of unidt (factor n/2)
Viz: need routine 2d plots with opendx networks
----
1. basic test with corotation
- quadrant, viz
-> where, why, how does it fail?
- boundary: spheres etc?
- fmr: onedt helpful/crucial? (need multigrid)
- fmr: can we get away with punctures?
